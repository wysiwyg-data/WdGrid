# wdGrid version 1.1 Change log - July 2024
===========================================


## 1. Add `grid_labels_align` option
This new option allows for different alignments between the grid column headers and column data.

If the option is omitted, the header alignment will follow the `grid_cols_align` option.


## 2. Add method for externally calling a grid data refresh: `get wg_RefreshGrid()`
With this method it is possible to force a data fetch and thus refresh the grid data.

Typical use: when a server-side data manipulation has occurred that would change the dataset already displayed by the grid. See an example of this in the `example.js` file, where the grid icons responses have been defined.


## 3. Move all grid strings and other tooltips in the locale file `<locale>.js`
The following options have been eliminated, please change your code accordingly:

- `grid_name` -> replaced by an entry in the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function
- `grid_strings` -> replaced by separate entries in the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function
- `grid_cols_labels` -> replaced by the `gridColsLabels` entry in the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function
- `hidden_cols_labels` -> replaced by the `hiddenColsLabels` entry in the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function
- `search_in` -> replaced by the `searchIn` entry in the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function

All strings should now be placed into the `js_grid_strings(pModule)` function in the locale file `<locale>.js` Simply add whatever sting you may need, such as a tooltip for your row icon. See the `en-NZ.js` file for details.


## 4. Move grid locale options to locale file
The following options have been eliminated, please change your code accordingly:

- `currency` -> replaced by the `currency` entry in the `vLocaleOpts` object
- `clock_type` -> replaced by the `clock_type` entry in the `vLocaleOpts` object

All locale options for the grid are now placed in the `vLocaleOpts` object in the locale file `<locale>.js` See the `en-NZ.js` file for details.


## 5. Simplified and improved currency display format
The currency format now uses the locale-dependant options above.

An additional grid option for the currency format has been added: `currency_dec` (default: 2) Simply set this option to change the number of decimals to be displayed.


## 6. Add "float" to the display format list
An additional grid option for the float format has also been added: `float_dec` (default: 2) Simply set this option to change the number of decimals to be displayed.


## 7. Remove `date_formats` option as redundant
The `date_formats` grid option was found redundant so it has been removed. The date formats are all defined in the `<locale>.js` file and can be utilised through the `js_wd_date_format()` hook function.


## 8. Add `warn_no_uuid` option
On startup, the grid checks whether a column with a unique row identifier is present: the `uuid_col` option. If this option has accidentally been left unset (empty) the grid cannot perform any operation on the data, and consequently will produce an alert by default since the `warn_no_uuid` is set to true.

If the `uuid_col` option is deliberately left unset, in case of a read-only grid for example, then there is no need for a warning message, in which case set the `warn_no_uuid` to false.


## 9. Remove `multi` option
This option was found to be over-engineered and added more complexity (and probably confusion) to the code.

Now the `multi` option is permanently set to true. This does not affect single grid displays and simplifies multi-grid projects.


## 10. Add documentation on hooks
The documentation on hook functions was missing. It has now been added to the ReadMe file.
